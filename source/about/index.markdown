"do" is a podcast about Ruby, Rubyists and their culture.  We hope to grow to
be a regular (at this stage, two-weekly) show, with a rotating panel of up to
10 people.

## Get involved.

The show schedule is managed in our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/do-podcast/do-podcast.github.io/issues),
ideas for future shows can also be raised as issues for discussion, and may
wind up being assigned to the schedule (issue milestones) for future recording.

Here's how you can get involved:

  * If you'd like to be on a panel, add yourself to the panel list of
    an [upcoming show](https://github.com/do-podcast/do-podcast.github.io/issues?labels=not+yet+recorded&page=1&state=open).
    _no more than 5 panelists, plus guest per show please!_

  * If you'd like to be present at the recording of one of our episodes? Just
    [follow us on Google+](https://plus.google.com/104323044464093018582) and
    we'll post events for our upcoming hangouts-on-air.

  * Make show or interview suggestions by raising or commenting on our GitHub
    issues.

  * During live recording sessions you can ask questions on
    [#dopodcast on freenode](irc://irc.freenode.org/dopodcast) or that show's
    GitHub issue.  We'll attempt to summarise and raise them with our guests.
